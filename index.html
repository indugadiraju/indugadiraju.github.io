          <h1>Hi, I'm Indu :)</h1>
          <p class="lede">
            I’m a student at Stanford studying computer science (AI), electrical engineering, and philosophy.
          </p>
          <p class="lede">
            I grew up just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina, where I spent a lot of time tinkering, building, and working with my local community – learning how technology can meaningfully serve people at large scales.
          </p>
          <p class="lede">
            I’m especially interested in applied AI, embedded systems and robotics, environmental sensing, and building technology with tangible community impact – which I’ve explored through <a href="projects.html"> a range of projects </a>. Beyond tech, I enjoy <a href="writing.html"> writing </a>, design, entrepreneurship, and interdisciplinary detours.
          </p>
